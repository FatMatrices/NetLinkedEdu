## What is  NetLinkedEdu?##
NetLinkedEdu is an open source(for now) project that will eventually become a platform for schools. It will be a mixture of a school website service, [powerschool](http://powerschool.com), and [schoology](http://schoology.com). I personally think that they both WORK well but don't have very good uptime and lack ease of use.
## Great for schools with developers on the team ##
The code is intended to commented really well to the point that the webmaster can understand the entire project well enough to edit the base code.
